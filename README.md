# VimVSCode Configure
Automize Vim and VSCode configuration with your favorite plugins and extensions!

Here presented my favorite Vim plugins, color theme (Monokai for vim ) and extensions for VSCode.

*Note*: This setup uses Linux scripts, also for some reasons doesn't install VSCode plugins for WSL.
Feel free to use :)
